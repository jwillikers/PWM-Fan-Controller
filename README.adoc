PWM fan controller written in {Rust} targeting different microcontrollers.
Currently, these are basic examples for setting the {Noctua-NF-P12-redux-1700-PWM-Fan} to a quiescent 40% speed.
Implementations for specific boards can be found in the `boards` directory.
The implementations include boards targeting the Arm, AVR, and RISC-V architectures.

== Develop

{Nix} is used to manage dependencies, toolchains, and development environments for each board.
This makes it possible to develop locally in an environment that is consistent with CI.
The `nix develop` command can be used to enter or run commands in an environment with all of the necessary dependencies.
For convenience, direnv can be used to automatically load this environment when entering the project's directory.
The https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.direnv[mkhl.direnv VSCode extension] integrates this environment in VSCode for development.
The repository contains configuration for https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit], which can be used to automate formatting and various checks when committing changes.
Follow the instructions here to set up your development environment.

. Install an implementation of {Nix}, such as https://lix.systems[Lix] used here.
+
[,sh]
----
curl -sSf -L https://install.lix.systems/lix | sh -s -- install
----

. Install direnv for your system according to the https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html[direnv installation instructions].
+
[,sh]
----
sudo rpm-ostree install direnv
sudo systemctl reboot
----

. Integrate direnv with your shell by following the instructions on the https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html[direnv Setup page].

. Clone the repository.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/pwm-fan-controller.git
----

. Permit the direnv configuration for the desired board or boards in the repository.
The following command allows loading the environments for all boards.
+
[,sh]
----
direnv allow boards/*
----

. Run `pre-commit install` to configure pre-commit hooks in the repository.
+
[,sh]
----
pre-commit install
----

. The {just} command runner can be used to perform common tasks, such as building the and flashing the firmware for a particular board.
The commands do not automatically use or assume a Nix environment.
When in the directory for a particular board, this shouldn't be a problem as direnv automatically loads the Nix environment.
However, the top-level directory does not load any environment, so use `nix develop` as required to execute the `just commands`.
+
[,sh]
----
nix develop '.#attiny85' --command just flash attiny85
----

=== Serial Port Permissions

On Linux, most distributions require the user to be in a particular group to access serial ports.
Here, I document the particular steps required to permit access to serial ports on Fedora Atomic variants.

. On Fedora Atomic, the _dialout_ group does not exist in the `/etc/group`, so it must be added there.
+
[,sh]
----
echo (getent group dialout) | sudo tee -a /etc/group
----

. Add the user to the _dialout_ group to access USB without requiring superuser privileges.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo usermod --append --groups dialout $USER
----

. Log out and back in for the group change to take effect.
