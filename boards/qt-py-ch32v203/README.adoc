PWM fan controller for the {QT-Py-CH32V203} RISC-V board written in {Rust}.
This fan controller just sets the fan speed to 40% speed to reduce noise from the {Noctua-NF-P12-redux-1700-PWM-Fan}.

== Hardware

The {QT-Py-CH32V203} uses the CH32V203G8 RISC-V microcontroller.
All the hardware components in my particular build are enumerated here.

Programming will require a USB-C cable and a computer.
If you don't already have one, you'll probably want a fan, too.
This circuit is meant for a 12V fan.
I use this controller for the {Noctua-NF-P12-redux-1700-PWM-Fan}.

== How it Works

This is a dead-simple PWM fan controller that simply lowers the speed of the {Noctua-NF-P12-redux-1700-PWM-Fan} to a quiescent 40% speed.
The microcontroller simply sets the fan speed and then does nothing.
The fan setup might evolve in the future to take into account temperature sensing and dynamic speed adjustment.

The 3.3V QT Py CH32V203 requires a logic-level shifter to boost the PWM signal up to 5V for the fan.
I use the 74AHCT125 to perform the logic-level conversion, using pin #40, `VBUS`, to provide the 5V reference voltage.

The QT Py CH32V203 draws only 1.11 mA of current in this particular configuration.

== Getting Started

. Change to the board's directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd pwm-fan-controller/boards/qt-py-ch32v203
----

. Add a udev rule to be able to access the QT Py CH32V203 as a non-root user.
+
./etc/udev/rules.d/60-qt-py-ch32v203.rules
[source]
----
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="4348", ATTRS{idProduct}=="55e0", TAG+="uaccess"
----

. While holding the `BOOT` button, attach the QT Py CH32V203 to your computer via the USB-C port.

. Flash the board using the `nix run` command with the `qt-py-ch32v203.flash.wchisp` target.
+
[,sh]
----
nix run '../..#qt-py-ch32v203.flash.wchisp'
----

== Todo

* Document connections with the 74AHCT125.
