PWM fan controller for the {Raspberry-Pi-Pico} written in {Rust}.
This fan controller just sets the fan speed to 40% speed to reduce noise from the {Noctua-NF-P12-redux-1700-PWM-Fan}.

Programming will require a micro USB cable and a computer.
If you don't already have one, you'll probably want a fan, too.
This circuit is meant for a 12V fan.
I use this controller for the {Noctua-NF-P12-redux-1700-PWM-Fan}.

== How it Works

This is a dead-simple PWM fan controller that simply lowers the speed of the {Noctua-NF-P12-redux-1700-PWM-Fan} to a quiescent 40% speed.
The microcontroller simply sets the fan speed and then does nothing.
The fan setup might evolve in the future to take into account temperature sensing and dynamic speed adjustment.

The 3.3V Raspberry Pi Pico requires a logic-level shifter to boost the PWM signal up to 5V for the fan.
I use the 74AHCT125 to perform the logic-level conversion, using pin #40, `VBUS`, to provide the 5V reference voltage.

The Raspberry Pi Pico draws 1.99 mA of current in this particular configuration.

== Getting Started

. Change to the board's directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd pwm-fan-controller/boards/pico
----

. While holding the `BOOT` button, attach the Pico to your computer using the micro-USB port.

. Mount the drive provided by the Pico.
This can be determined by perusing the block devices available from the `lsblk` command.
To mount `/dev/sda1`, as in my case, use the `udisksctl` command like so.
+
[,sh]
----
udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sda1
----

. Flash the board using the `nix run` command with the `pico.flash.elf2uf2-rs` target.
+
[,sh]
----
nix run '../..#pico.flash.elf2uf2-rs'
----

// == Develop

// . Double check that link:.cargo/config.toml[.cargo/config.toml] has the runner set to `elf2uf2-rs -d`.

== Probe

Any CMSIS-DAP compatible debug probe should work with probe-rs.
The {Raspberry-Pi-Debug-Probe} is the most straightforward probe to use for this, and quite affordable.
If you happen to have another Raspberry Pi Pico on-hand, this can be used as a debug probe by following the directions in the <<Pico Probe>> section.

If you want to use a probe with the `cargo run` command, be sure that link:.cargo/config.toml[.cargo/config.toml] has the runner set to `probe-run --chip RP2040 --protocol swd`.

=== Raspberry Pi Debug Probe

. Add a udev rule to be able to access the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe as a non-root user.
+
./etc/udev/rules.d/60-pico-debug-probe.rules
[source]
----
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2e8a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="000c", TAG+="uaccess"
----

. Unplug the probe, and plug it back in for the udev rule to take effect.

// todo Wiring.
. Connect the probe to the Raspberry Pi Pico.

. Flash and run the firmware using the `nix run` command with the `pico.run.probe-rs` target.
Alternatively, use the just command `just run dev probe-rs`.
+
[,sh]
----
nix run '.#pico.run.probe-rs'
----

=== Pico Probe

The `UF2` method is handy for programming microcontrollers without requiring any additional hardware.
However, debug probes are quite convenient for flashing and debugging code running on the microcontroller.
There are many debuggers available on the market, but there's something quaint about using a spare Pico as a debugger.
The {PicoProbe-PCB-kit} is a nifty add-on that makes it a bit more convenient to use the Pico as a probe.
The steps here describe how to use a Pico as a debug probe with the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe firmware and wire everything up.

. While holding the `BOOTSEL` button on the Raspberry Pi Pico, connect it to the computer.

. Mount the drive provided by the Pico.
This can be determined by perusing the block devices available from the `lsblk` command.
To mount `/dev/sda1`, as in my case, use the `udisksctl` command like so.
+
[,sh]
----
udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sda1
----

. Download and install the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe firmware to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
+
[,sh]
----
curl --location --output-dir=/run/media/$USER/RPI-RP2 --remote-name \
  https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe/releases/download/debugprobe-v2.0.1/debugprobe_on_pico.uf2
----

. Connect the debug probe Pico to the Pico to flash according to the {Picoprobe-Wiring} documentation.

| GND | GND

. Now just follow the directions in the <<Raspberry Pi Debug Probe>> section to flash the target Pico.
