PWM fan controller for the {Raspberry-Pi-Pico} written in {Rust}.
This fan controller just sets the fan speed to 40% speed to reduce noise from the {Noctua-NF-P12-redux-1700-PWM-Fan}.

Programming will require a micro USB cable and a computer.
If you don't already have one, you'll probably want a fan, too.
This circuit is meant for a 12V fan.
I use this controller for the {Noctua-NF-P12-redux-1700-PWM-Fan}.

== How it Works

This is a dead-simple PWM fan controller that simply lowers the speed of the {Noctua-NF-P12-redux-1700-PWM-Fan} to a quiescent 40% speed.
The microcontroller simply sets the fan speed and then does nothing.
The fan setup might evolve in the future to take into account temperature sensing and dynamic speed adjustment.

The 3.3V Raspberry Pi Pico requires a logic-level shifter to boost the PWM signal up to 5V for the fan.
I use the 74AHCT125 to perform the logic-level conversion, using pin #40, `VBUS`, to provide the 5V reference voltage.

The Raspberry Pi Pico draws 1.99 mA of current in this particular configuration.

=== Wiring

The 74AHCT125 is wired as shown in the <<74AHCT125 Wiring>> table.
All pins omitted from the table are connected to ground.

| 74AHCT125 | Signal

| 1
| 3.3 Volt power

| 9
| 3.3 Volt PWM input signal

| 10
| 5 Volt PWM output signal
|===

The output signal from the logic-level shifter is sent through the 1N4001 power blocking diode to the fan header.
The pins on the 4-pin fan header are classified in the <<4-pin Fan Header Pinout>> table.
The pins are numbered one through four from left to right with the pins reaching upwards and the overhang positioned between the viewer and the pins.

== Getting Started

. Change to the board's directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd pwm-fan-controller/boards/pico
----

. While holding the `BOOT` button, attach the Pico to your computer using the micro-USB port.

. Mount the drive provided by the Pico.
This can be determined by perusing the block devices available from the `lsblk` command.
To mount `/dev/sda1`, as in my case, use the `udisksctl` command like so.
+
[,sh]
----
udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sda1
----

. Double check that link:.cargo/config.toml[.cargo/config.toml] has the runner set to `elf2uf2-rs -d`.

. Flash the board using the `nix run` command with the `pico.flash.elf2uf2-rs` target.
+
[,sh]
----
nix run ../..#pico.flash.elf2uf2-rs
----

== Probe

The `UF2` method is handy for programming microcontrollers without requiring any additional hardware.
However, debug probes are quite convenient for flashing and debugging code running on the microcontroller.
Any CMSIS-DAP compatible debug probe should work with probe-rs.
The {Raspberry-Pi-Debug-Probe} is the most straightforward probe to use for this, and quite affordable.
If you happen to have another Raspberry Pi Pico on-hand, this can be used as a debug probe.
Follow the instructions in <<Probe Firmware>> to install the necessary firmware to convert the Pico into a debug probe.
The {PicoProbe-PCB-kit} is a nifty add-on that makes it a bit more convenient to use the Pico as a probe.
Whichever probe you happen to choose, configure udev to give your user access to the probe by following these instructions.

. Add a udev rule to be able to access the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe as a non-root user.
+
./etc/udev/rules.d/60-pico-debug-probe.rules
[source]
----
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2e8a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="000c", TAG+="uaccess"
----

. Unplug the probe, and plug it back in for the udev rule to take effect.

If you want to use a probe with the `cargo run` command, be sure that link:.cargo/config.toml[.cargo/config.toml] has the runner set to `probe-run --chip RP2040 --protocol swd`.

=== Probe Firmware

The Pico Probe and the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe use variations of the same firmware.
The firmware is installed and upgraded in the same way.
I recommend using the latest firmware.
It's very easy to install.
Raspberry Pi releases official firmware in their https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe[Debug Probe] repository.
I prefer the firmware from the https://github.com/rgrr/yapicoprobe/[Yet Another Picoprobe] project, which is used in these instructions.
It's a bit faster and provides more information about the connection through the LED.

. While holding the `BOOTSEL` button on the Raspberry Pi Pico or Raspberry Pi Debug Probe, connect it to the computer.

. Mount the drive provided by the Pico.
This can be determined by perusing the block devices available from the `lsblk` command.
To mount `/dev/sda1`, as in my case, use the `udisksctl` command like so.
+
[,sh]
----
udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sda1
----

. Download and install the appropriate firmware for the device.

=== Probe Wiring

This Raspberry Pi Pico uses a 3-pin debug connector on end of the board opposite the microUSB connector, right below the Raspberry Pi logo.
This is documented in detail in the {Raspberry-Pi-3-pin-Debug-Connector-Specification}.
The pins are numbered one through three from left to right when the board is oriented such that the Raspberry Pi logo is upright.
The Raspberry Pi Debug Probe utilizes a JST-SH connector.
If your Pico uses a JST-SH connector, making the connection is straightforward.
If it doesn't, the following table describes each connection, including the color of each wire for the adapter that comes with the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe.

.Raspberry Pi 3-pin Debug Connector Pinout

When using a standalone Pico as a probe, connect the pins to the target Pico according to the following table.
Refer to the {Picoprobe-Wiring} documentation for further details.

=== Use the Probe

Follow these steps to run the code on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

. Connect the probe to the Raspberry Pi Pico using the connections described in the <<Probe Wiring>> section.

. Flash and run the firmware using the `nix run` command with the `pico.run.probe-rs` target.
Alternatively, use the just command `just run dev probe-rs`.
+
[,sh]
----
nix run .#pico.run.probe-rs
